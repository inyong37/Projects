### Indoor Autonomous Flight Algorithm using Computer Vision Deep Learning Model based on Optical Character Recognition and Depth Prediction

The purpose of "Indoor Autonomous Flight Algorithm using Computer Vision Deep Learning Model based on Optical Character Recognition and Depth Prediction" is to design an algorithm that safely moves the drone to the desired location indoors. This algorithm consists of two path planning. The first one is the local path planning which predicts the depth from the frontal image, and determines that the deepest part has no obstacles, and selects a path for flight. Next, the global path planning finds the name of a room by recognizing the letters on the side image, finds its location on the existing map, and sets the route to the destination. This system was inspired by how humans naivage. And just like humans, I designed the system to find its way by comparing the names of rooms and the map.
