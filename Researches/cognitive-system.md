### Cognitive System for the Visually Impaired

I designed a system that navigates the way by voice using sensors and a camera. Mainly I designed an algorithm that uses infrared distance sensors to determine if there are obstacles, uphill or downhill. And I used the Haar Cascade algorithm to train the image of the stairs, and determine whether it is a hill of a stair using a camera. And also, I designed the case using 3D printing, and implemented text-to-speech to notify the user with sound.
