### Alibi Maker

It is a creating synthetic alibi photos service to couples to lie to their parents that they went on a trip with their friends. If a user uploads photos of his or her friends and a travel spot as input, friends will be cropped from input photos and added to travel photos. Our team implemented a web service using OpenCV and AWS. For this project, I designed a computer vision algorithm to crop and merge people from photos.
